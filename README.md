#DOM Exercise
Have to use a template provided by Odin Project to add content using ***DOM methods*** that I learned.
Will use quotes from childhood show to finish tasks below. 

1) <p> with **red text** that says *"Who you callin' Pinhead? I wanna be Dirty Dan!"*
2) <h3> with **blue text** that says *"What makes you think you can be Dirty Dan?"*
3) <div> with  **black border** and **pink background color** with the following elements inside of it:
    a) <h1> that says *"I'm dirty."*
    b) <p> that says *"I'd say I'm Dirty Dan!"*

    <sub> To help with this task for <div> part, I need to append <h1> and <p> to div before adding it to container. </sub>
